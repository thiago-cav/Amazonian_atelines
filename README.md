Interactive maps and script generated by Cavalcante et al, "Modelling 21st century refugia and impact of climate change on Amazonia's largest primates" (Under review in Journal of Biogeography)

# Data
This folder contains the R script used for the multi-species distribution modelling with the parameter implementation settings and the interactive maps showing the hotspots of vulnerability to climate change and 21st century refugia for all Amazonian atelines (please
see details in Metadata PDF file).

Contents
1. Moderate scenario
    - Maps for each taxon under the moderate scenario of climate change.
2. Worst scenario
    - Maps for each taxon under the worst scenario of climate change.
3. Metadata
    - Basic information for accessing and using the interactive maps.
4. R script
    - R script used for the multi-species distribution modelling with the parameter implementation settings.
